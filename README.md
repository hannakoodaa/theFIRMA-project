# theFIRMA-project

This is a very basic node.js/express project. I have been in charge of files in /public (so style.css and functions.js in there are made by me).

Also /views/Input.pug is 99% made by me. 

The site takes values from the user and then checks from the database what the values mean. Due this being a customer project, I changed variable names etc.
